# Basic URL Shortener application

This is a basic URL shortener application built with Vue.js on the Frontend and Laravel for the backend. It is designed to check if a URL is safe to be shortnened via the Google safe browsing API.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

    PHP 8.2.12
    MySQL 5.7 or newer
    Composer
    Node.js v20.13.1 or newer

### Installing

1. Clone the repository and cd into it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alban-Kaperi/url_shortener
cd basic-url-shortener
```

2. Install PHP dependencies

```bash
composer install
```

3. Copy the example environment file and generate an application key

```bash
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

4. Edit .env file and set up the database credentials with your own, example like below:

```makefile
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=database_name
DB_USERNAME=database_user
DB_PASSWORD=database_password
```

Add the following key(update with your google **API_KEY**) to the .env file:
`
GOOGLE_SAFE_BROWSING=https://safebrowsing.googleapis.com/v4/threatMatches:find?key=API_KEY`

5. Migrate the database and seed some initial data

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

6. Import the database, via one of the tools of your preference e.g phpmyadmin, Adminer, Navicat etc.
   Database dump is located in: `/database/database_dump.sql`

7. Install NPM dependencies and compile assets

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

8. Start the development server

```bash
php artisan serve
```

You should now be able to access the application at link generated by the artisan command that is consoled in your terminal, usually it would be something like this: http://localhost:8000

9. Where is most of the logic:
   For the backend:

```bash
routes\web.php
routes\api.php
app/Http/Controllers/Api/v1/UrlShortenerController.php
app\Services\GoogleSafeBrowsingService.php
app\Helpers\UrlHelper.php
```

    For the frontend:

```bash
resources\js\pages\Home.vue
```
